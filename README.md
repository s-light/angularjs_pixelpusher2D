# angularjs_shapepusher2D
simple angular.js directive for 2D box layout things...

similar to a very striped down graphic editor.

woks:
- shows 2D shapes on a 2D-canvas (SVG-based)
- select single/muliple shapes
- select with border (box selection) (inklusive forceItemEnclosure option)
- drag and drop with mouse / touch to move the shapes on the canvas
- on move - snap to grid
- move all selected shapes
- now move of items and box select works on touch devices


todo:
- fix bug with snap and move selected

goals:
- different touch friendly add/remove/toggle modes for the box selection
- zoom in&out / drag canvas around

features
- group shapes
